Big Dipper
=======

Big Dipper is a widely used blockchain explorer developed by [Forbole](https://www.forbole.com/).

This deployment consists of 2 containers, one running MongoDB, the other running the web frontend.

The image was built using the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/forbole/big-dipper/tree/akash-challenge-3) from github, and the SDL file adapted from the docker-compose file in the same repo.
