# Status

This project is in **Beta** status. This means for most tasks, Swarm has excellent tooling available to you, but there is much more planned. Swarm is recommended as an ideal UI for most users, beginners and pros alike. There are still some things to be worked out.

Beginner users will love Swarm's primary Generate tab interface, making it easy to generate anything with a variety of powerful features. Advanced users may favor the Comfy Workflow tab to get the unrestricted raw graph, but will still have reason to come back to the Generate tab for convenience features (image editor, auto-workflow-generation, etc) and powertools (eg Grid Generator).

Those interested in helping push Swarm from Beta to a Full ready-for-anything perfected Release status are welcome to submit PRs (read the [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) document first), and you can contact us here on GitHub or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/q2y38cqjNw). I highly recommended reaching out to ask about plans for a feature before PRing it. There may already be specific plans or even a work in progress.

Key feature targets not yet implemented:
- Better mobile browser support
- full detail "Current Model" display in UI, separate from the model selector (probably as a tab within the batch sidebar?)
    - And a way to dynamically shift tabs around between spots for convenience / layout customization
- LLM-assisted prompting
- convenient direct-distribution of Swarm as a program (Electron app?)

# Documentation

See [the documentation folder](/docs/README.md).

# Motivations

The "Swarm" name is in reference to the original key function of the UI: enabling a 'swarm' of GPUs to all generate images for the same user at once (especially for large grid generations). This is just the feature that inspired the name and not the end all of what Swarm is.

The overall goal of StableSwarmUI is to a be full-featured one-stop-shop for all things Stable Diffusion.

See [the motivations document](/docs/Motivations.md) for motivations on technical choices.
