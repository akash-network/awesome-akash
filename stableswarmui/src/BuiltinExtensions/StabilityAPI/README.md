# StabilityAPI Extension

Adds a backend that makes remote calls to the Stability API.

Requires an API key - refer to [the developer platform documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started/authentication)

Currently requires selecting a local model, and then selecting the "Engine" as a parameter - TODO: the engines should be listed in the models UI instead.
