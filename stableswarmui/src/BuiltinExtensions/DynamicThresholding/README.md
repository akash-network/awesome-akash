# Dynamic Thresholding

StableSwarmUI extension that implements support for [Dynamic Thresholding](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/sd-dynamic-thresholding), built in by default to Swarm.

Dynamic Thresholding is a technique that allows for generating at very large CFG Scale values without the image burning.

Functions as a set of optional parameters only visible when you check `Display Advanced Options`.

This extension also has parameters for related features such as CFG Scale Scheduling.
