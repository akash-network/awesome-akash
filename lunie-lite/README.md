# Lunie-Lite Wallet

From [the project site](https://github.com/luniehq/lunie-light):

Lunie Light is a staking interface for proof-of-stake blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem — built for speed, simplicity, and ease-of-use.

Lunie Light uses [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), and relies on the [REST API](https://cosmos.network/rpc) of a [Cosmos node](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/interfaces/rest.html) for data.

Lunie Light will work with the Keplr Browser Extension and the Ledger Nano. Local key management should only be used for testing and development purposes.
