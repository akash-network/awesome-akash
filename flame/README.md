# Flame

From [Flame](https://github.com/pawelmalak/flame)

Flame is self-hosted startpage for your server. Its design is inspired (heavily) by [SUI](https://github.com/jeroenpardon/sui). Flame is very easy to setup and use. With built-in editors, it allows you to setup your very own application hub in no time - no file editing necessary.
