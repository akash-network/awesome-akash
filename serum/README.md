# Serum DEX UI

From [the project site](https://projectserum.com/):

Serum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and ecosystem that brings unprecedented speed and low transaction costs to decentralized finance. It is built on Solana and is completely permissionless.

* On-chain Orderbooks: Full limit orderbooks with an interface familiar to that of centralized exchanges
* Speed: Sub-second trading and settlement
* Cost: Lower transaction costs than any other DEX: $0.00001 per transaction
