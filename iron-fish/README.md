Our goal is for Iron Fish to be the most accessible and decentralized privacy platform for web3.  Miners are essential to the health of the Iron Fish network. Without them, blocks won't be generated and transactions won't be transmitted. Iron Fish is still at the testnet stage.

Iron Fish is a Layer 1 blockchain that provides the strongest privacy guarantees on every single transaction. Leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs), and the highest industry standards for encryption.

We are currently running an incentivized testnet where you can earn points by mining blocks and contributing to the network. To participate, visit our testnet website to learn more.
