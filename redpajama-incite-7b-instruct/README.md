# RedPajama-INCITE-7B-Instruct

RedPajama-INCITE-7B-Instruct is a text generation application. It was developed by Together and leaders from the open-source AI community including Ontocord.ai, ETH DS3Lab, AAI CERC, Université de Montréal, MILA - Québec AI Institute, Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM), Stanford Hazy Research research group and LAION.
The model was fine-tuned for few-shot applications on the data of GPT-JT, with exclusion of tasks that overlap with the HELM core scenarios.

This application requires a GPU with 16GB memory. It is recommended to use a video card NVIDIA H100.

After launch container, the application should download the trained model from the project repository, these are two files with a total weight of 13.8Gb and it may take some time depending on the internet speed of GPU provider.
