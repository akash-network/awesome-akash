# Alpaca.cpp

Run a fast ChatGPT-like model locally on your device. The screencast below is not sped up and running on an M2 Macbook Air with 4GB of weights.

This combines the [LLaMA foundation model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) with an [open reproduction](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) of [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) a fine-tuning of the base model to obey instructions (akin to the [RLHF](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) used to train ChatGPT) and a set of modifications to [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to add a chat interface.

This combines [Facebook's LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), [Stanford Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html), [alpaca-lora](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) and [corresponding weights](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b/tree/main) by Eric Wang (which uses [Jason Phang's implementation of LLaMA](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/21955) on top of Hugging Face Transformers), and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) by Georgi Gerganov. The chat implementation is based on Matvey Soloviev's [Interactive Mode](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/61) for llama.cpp. Inspired by [Simon Willison's](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-7b-m2) getting started guide for LLaMA. [Andy Matuschak](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1636769182066053120)'s thread on adapting this to 13B, using fine tuning weights by [Sam Witteveen](https://huggingface.co/samwit/alpaca13B-lora).


## Disclaimer

Note that the model weights are only to be used for research purposes, as they are derivative of LLaMA, and uses the published instruction data from the Stanford Alpaca project which is generated by OpenAI, which itself disallows the usage of its outputs to train competing models.
