# Profitable Multipool Mining
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowMiner/miner-binaries/master/rainbowminerhome.png "RainbowMiner Web GUI")

GPU/CPU Mining script with intelligent auto-switching between different miningpools, algorithm, miner programs using all possible combinations of devices (NVIDIA, AMD, INTEL and CPU), optionally including cost of electricity into profit calculations and  stop mining, if no longer profitable.
Features: easy setup wizard with ad-hoc working default (no editing of files needed), GUI-webinterface, selection of devices to be used, very low CPU usage.

## FEATURE SUMMARY

- **Multi-Platform (AMD, INTEL, NVIDIA, CPU) on Windows and Linux**
- **Profit auto-switch between mining programs and [algorithm](https://rbminer.net/algorithms/) for GPUs & CPUs (optimized one for each vendor vs. one for each possible device combination)**
- **Profit auto-switch between pools (2Miners, 6Block, Acepool, Aionmine, Aionpool, Alphpool, BaikalMiner, Binance, BlockCruncher, BlockMasters, C3pool, EthashPool, Ethermine, [ezil.me](https://ezil.me/?p=dcf9), F2pool, FlexPool, FlockPool, FluxPools, FlyPool, GosCx, GrinMint, Hashcryptos, Hashpool, HashVault, [HeroMiners](https://herominers.com), Hiveon, Icemining, LeafPool, LuckPool, LuckyPool, Minerpool, Minafacil, MinerRocks, MiningDutch, MiningPoolHub, MiningPoolOvh, [MiningRigRentals](https://www.miningrigrentals.com?ref=2598069), Mintpond, MoneroOcean, Nanopool, [Nicehash](https://www.nicehash.com/?refby=c402ea4d-9203-414c-b96e-526e34ad20e1), Poolin, Poolium, Ravenminer, SeroPool, SoloPool, Sunpool, SuprNova, unMineable, UUpool, WoolyPooly, [Zergpool](https://zergpool.com/?address=&refcode=78f6ec9427d56069f93709d7805a6a56) and Zpool)**
- **Integrate own and custom pools**
- **Profit calculation, including real cost of electricity per miner**
- **Uses the top actual available miner programs (Bminer, Ccminer, Claymore, CryptoDredge, Dstm, EnemyZ, Ewbf, Gminer, NBminer, Sgminer, SrbMiner, T-Rex, Xmrig and many more)**
- **Easy setup wizard with ad-hoc working default - click Start.bat and off you go (RainbowMiner will ask for your credentials, no hassle with editing configuration files)**
- **Client\Server networking for multiple rigs - minimizes internet traffic and avoids pool bans**
- **Scheduler for different power prices and/or pause during specific timespans**
- **Built-in automatic update**
- **Mine with any device, arbitrarily - Mining devices freely selectable**
- **Finetune miner- and pool-configuration during runtime**
- **Bind/exclude devices to and from specific algorithm and miners**
- **Define algorithms and/or to mine, per pool**
- **Unlimited custom overclocking profiles per miner/algorithm**
- **Easy overclocking of GPUs (memory, core, power limit and voltage)**
- **Switch MSI Afterburner profiles per miner/algorithm**
- **Includes [OhGodAnETHlargementPill](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3370685.0)**
- **Very low CPU usage to increase CPU mining profit**
- **Pause mining without exiting the RainbowMiner**
- **Full automatic update**
- **Easy replication and setup configuration**
- **Very small minimum developer fee of 0.7% (10 minutes per day) to support my work**
- **Live monitoring web-interface at [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)**
- **Central monitoring of all your rigs at [https://rbminer.net](https://rbminer.net)**
- **Offline notifications via email and/or https://pushover.net**


RainbowMiner supports more than 60 pools and 80 different mining programs.

RainbowMiner fully integrates with MiningRigRentals.com: it has never been easier to rent out your rig. Just activate MiningRigRentals, set your API credentials and RainbowMiner will take care of the rest. Rigs will be created and updated at MRR completely automatically.
