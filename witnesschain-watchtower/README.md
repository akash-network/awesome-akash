# üóº Run a Witness Chain Watchtower on Akash

This is a template for running a Witness Chain Watchtower on Akash. It enables users to run Witness Chain's [watchtower](https://docs.witnesschain.com/infinity-watch/proof-of-location-mainnet/run-a-watchtower/for-partner-node-runners/running-on-akash-cloud) directly from the Akash Console and participate in the [Proof of Location](https://docs.witnesschain.com/infinity-watch/proof-of-location-mainnet) protocol.

## üëÄ Usage

To participate, you need to first [register your Watchtower Keys](https://docs.witnesschain.com/infinity-watch/proof-of-location-mainnet/run-a-watchtower/for-partner-node-runners/running-on-akash-cloud#id-1.-registering-the-watchtower-key).  Afterwards, you can use this template to configure and run the Witness Chain watchtower with Akash compute; the watchtower will prove itself first and then enable a PoL challenger automatically.
