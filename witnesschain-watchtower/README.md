# üóº Run a Witness Chain Watchtower on Akash

This is a template for running a Witness Chain Watchtower on Akash. It enables users to run Witness Chain's [watchtower](https://docs.witnesschain.com/depin-coordination-layer/proof-of-location/for-depin-node-providers/running-a-watchtower) directly from the Akash Console and participate in the [Proof of Location](https://docs.witnesschain.com/depin-coordination-layer/proof-of-location) protocol.

## üëÄ Usage

To participate, you need to first [register your Challenger Keys](https://docs.witnesschain.com/depin-coordination-layer/proof-of-location/for-depin-node-providers/running-a-watchtower#id-2.-registering-the-challenger-key).  Afterwards, you can use this template to configure and run the Witness Chain watchtower with Akash compute; the watchtower will prove itself first and then turn into a PoL challenger automatically.

# ‚õìÔ∏è About [Witnes Chain](http://witnesschain.com/)

[Witnes Chain](http://witnesschain.com/) is a decentralised verifiable observation network of watchtowers; witnessing and processing data from devices connecting physical world, spread all over the globe. This network of observed physical attributes are then programmed for state-of-the-art physical state consensus protocols like proof of location, proof of bandwith etc. Unlocking a whole new programmable witness paradigm. The watchtower network will soon support witnessing and verifying of GPUs and other AI applications as well!
