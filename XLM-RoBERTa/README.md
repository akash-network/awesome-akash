# XLM-RoBERTa on Akash

This repository contains the necessary files to deploy a Flask application that uses the XLM-RoBERTa language model on the Akash network. XLM-RoBERTa is a powerful language model that can understand and generate text in multiple languages.

Original Facebook Research repo: https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM

## Files

- `Dockerfile`: This file is used to build the Docker image for the application. It sets up an environment with Python and all the necessary libraries to run the XLM-RoBERTa model.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the Python packages that need to be installed in the Docker image. This includes Flask for the web application and the Transformers library for the XLM-RoBERTa model.
- `app.py`: This is the main application file. It creates a Flask web application that uses the XLM-RoBERTa model to predict masked tokens in a given text.
- `deploy.yaml`: This file defines the Akash deployment configuration for the application. It specifies the resources needed to run the application and the Docker image to use.

## Deployment

To deploy the application on the Akash network, you can use the deploy.yaml in this repository on Akash's new GPU marketplace using Cloudmos, Akash Console, or Akash CLI

## Usage

The application listens on port 80 and accepts POST requests to the `/predict` endpoint. The POST request should contain a JSON object with a single attribute 'text' that contains the text to be processed.

For example, you can use curl to send a POST request:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"This <mask> model can understand and generate text in multiple languages."}' http://your-akash-deployment-url/predict
```

## Future Steps 
BERT and RoBERTa are highly versatile language models that can be fine-tuned for a wide variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The models could be used to do any of the following:

Sentiment Analysis: You could fine-tune these models on a dataset of product reviews, social media comments, or any other text data to predict the sentiment of the text. This could be used by organizations to monitor customer feedback and public opinion about their products or services.

Text Classification: These models can be used to classify text into predefined categories. For example, a news organization could use this to automatically categorize news articles into topics like "Sports", "Politics", "Technology", etc.

Question Answering: BERT and RoBERTa can be trained to answer questions about a given context. This could be used to build a customer service chatbot that can answer frequently asked questions.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): NER is the task of identifying and classifying named entities in text (like person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.). This could be used in various fields like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement.

Text Generation: Although BERT and RoBERTa are not primarily designed for text generation, they can be used to generate text by predicting the next word in a sentence. This could be used to build a tool for writing assistance or content creation.

As for training these models on Akash, it's certainly possible. Training a large language model like BERT or RoBERTa requires a lot of computational resources, and Akash's decentralized cloud could potentially provide a cost-effective solution for this. However, training these models also requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data, which can be challenging to obtain.
