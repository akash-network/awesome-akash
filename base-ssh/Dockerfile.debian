# Use tini as an init system to manage orphaned child processes, ensuring they
# don't become zombie (defunct) processes by reaping (cleaning up) them when
# their parent process doesn't.
# Tini will also correctly handle signals like SIGTERM (15), allowing child
# processes to terminate gracefully within the allotted time, rather than
# being forcefully killed with SIGKILL after a 15-second timeout.
