A modified Ubuntu server 22.04 SDL by Dimokus, built to test the performance of persistent storage subsystem of an Akash provider.

How to use:
1. specify the storage class of the provider you want to test (beta1, beta2 or beta3)
2. Specify the root password in case you wish to connect to your deployment via ssh (not neccessary)
3. Deploy!
4. WAIT! On super-fast providers this test will take 10 minutes.

The test results will be displayed under "logs" in Akash Console
