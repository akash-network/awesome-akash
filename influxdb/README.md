# InfluxDB

InfluxDB is a time series database built from the ground up to handle high write and query loads.
InfluxDB is meant to be used as a backing store for any use case involving large amounts of 
timestamped data, including DevOps monitoring, application metrics, IoT sensor data, and 
real-time analytics.
