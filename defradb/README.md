# DefraDB

DefraDB is a user-centric database that prioritizes data ownership, personal privacy, and information security. Its data model, powered by the convergence of [MerkleCRDTs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00107.pdf) and the content-addressability of [IPLD](https://docs.ipld.io/), enables a multi-write-master architecture. It features [DQL](https://docs.source.network/references/query-specification/query-language-overview), a query language compatible with GraphQL but providing extra convenience. By leveraging peer-to-peer networking it can be deployed nimbly in novel topologies. Access control is determined by a relationship-based DSL, supporting document or field-level policies, secured by the SourceHub network. DefraDB is a core part of the [Source technologies](https://source.network/) that enable new paradigms of decentralized data and access-control management, user-centric apps, data trustworthiness, and much more.
