# Metabase

[Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) is the easy, open-source way for everyone in your company to ask questions and learn from data.

After the deployment is confirmed and running, open a browser and go to the IP address provided by the lease status (or by accessing Akashâ€™s dashboard if preferred). You should be able to access Metabase on the specified port, and it will lead you to the Metabase setup wizard.

##  Notes

- **Data Storage**: The SDL example above does not configure persistent storage. If you need persistence across restarts, consider integrating with an external database or using Akash persistent storage options.

- **Environment Variables**: Configure environment variables for Metabase (e.g., `MB_DB_FILE` or `MB_DB_*` for database connection details) by adding an env block within the services section if needed.
