Apache CouchDB™ lets you access your data where you need it by defining the Couch Replication Protocol that is implemented by a variety of projects 
and products that span every imaginable computing environment from globally distributed server-clusters, over mobile phones to web browsers. 
Software that is compatible with the Couch Replication Protocol include PouchDB and Cloudant.
