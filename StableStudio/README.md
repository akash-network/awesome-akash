# StableStudio

[StableStudio](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableStudio) is [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/)'s official open-source variant of [DreamStudio](https://dreamstudio.ai), our user interface for generative AI.

We're not entirely sure where this project is going just yet, but we're excited to see what the community does with it!
