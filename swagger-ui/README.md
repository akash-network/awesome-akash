# Swagger UI on Akash Network

This template deploys the official [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) container and lets you point it to your own OpenAPI specification.

## Deploy on Akash Console

1. Open deploy.yaml from this repo and fill in the environment variables. For configuration options, see [this page](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/blob/HEAD/docs/usage/configuration.md).
2. Use the template in the [Akash Console](https://console.akash.network/).
3. Open the URI in the "Leases" tab to access the Swagger UI. On some providers, you will need to manually open the URI in the "Leases" tab with HTTPS instead of HTTP.
