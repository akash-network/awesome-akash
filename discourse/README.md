# Discourse with dynamic hostname

When you're using discourse, and install the self hosted version, and follow the official instruction you need to have hostname to make sure our discourse work as expected, using my docker image and akash now you can easily deploy discourse decentrally on akash

# Prerequisites

- [akashlytics](https://www.akashlytics.com/deploy)
- [mailjet](https://app.mailjet.com/signin)

# Step 1 - Create mailjet account

In order for our application to send message via smtp we need to have some service to send email from, for now using my image you can only send via mailjet, so first create account on [mailjet](https://app.mailjet.com/signin)

# Step 2 - Deploy via akashlytics

# Step 3 - Add sender address in mailjet account

Login to your mailjet account, and then go here https://app.mailjet.com/account/sender after that click `Add domain`
