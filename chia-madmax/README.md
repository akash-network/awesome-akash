# What is Chia Madmax?

This is a new implementation of a chia plotter which is designed as a processing pipeline, similar to how GPUs work, only the "cores" are normal software CPU threads.  As a result this plotter is able to fully max out any storage device's bandwidth, simply by increasing the number of "cores", ie. threads.
