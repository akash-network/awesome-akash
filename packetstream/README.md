# Provider limitations

Many websites use IP lookup databases to determine a visitor's geolocation and whether the request is from a residential or datacenter IP. If traffic is determined to be from a restricted region or from a non-residential IP address, content is often blocked or restricted. In some cases access is allowed but deceiving information is returned to datacenter IP addresses to limit the effectiveness of automated access and scraping. PacketStream allows customers to relay their web requests through residential IP addresses to avoid these restrictions.

# Is all communication between relays secure?

A proxy client making HTTPS requests to an endpoint first initiates a TLS handshake that negotiates encryption keys directly with the endpoint server before any data is transmitted. The decryption key is never transmitted across the network and cannot be obtained by any Packeter relaying data in the middle. It's considered best practice to avoid relaying sensitive data to endpoints that don't support secure requests.

# Technology

PacketStream's multi-hop proxy tunnel enables businesses automation tooling to access more reliable data and unlock geolocation-restricted content.
