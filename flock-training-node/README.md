# ðŸŒ³ Run a FLock Training Node on Akash

This is a template for running a FLock Training Node on Akash. It enables users to run FLock's [Training Node Quickstart Script](https://github.com/FLock-io/testnet-training-node-quickstart) directly from the Akash Console and earn FML rewards on [train.flock.io](http://train.flock.io/).

[train.flock.io](http://train.flock.io/) is the gateway to [FLock.io](http://flock.io/)'s decentralized AI training platform, AI Arena. It is currently on incentivised testnet, and all participants who have earned FML rewards will receive mainnet airdrops.

To participate, you need to first [get whitelisted](https://blog.flock.io/news/trainflock), acquire [FML test tokens](https://train.flock.io/faucet) and test tokens for Base Sepolia, then [stake FML](https://train.flock.io/stake) on the task you wish to train models for.  Afterwards, you can use this template to run training tasks with Akash compute; the script automates the entire Training Node process, from downloading training dataset, model training, uploading to a Hugging Face repo, and submitting the training task.
