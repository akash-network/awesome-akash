From [the official Docker Hub image page](https://hub.docker.com/_/vault):

Vault is a tool for securely accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and more.

The `deploy.yaml` uses the official Docker image to deploy a basic configuration of Vault Server on Akash.

Please update this config according to your needs.
