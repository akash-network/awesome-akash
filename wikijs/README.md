# Wiki.js

From [the project site](https://github.com/Requarks/wiki):

A modern, lightweight and powerful wiki app built on NodeJS.

The `deploy.yaml` uses the [official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/requarks/wiki) and the [documentation](https://docs.requarks.io/install/docker) to deploy a Wiki.js backed by a sqlite database on Akash.
