A disk benchmark to test your hard drive read-write speed in Python.  A simplistic script to show that such system programming tasks are possible and convenient to be solved in Python

The file is being created, then written with random data, randomly read
and deleted, so the script doesn't waste your drive

# Usage
```
usage: monkeytest.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-s SIZE] [-w WRITE_BLOCK_SIZE]
                     [-r READ_BLOCK_SIZE] [-j JSON]
```
