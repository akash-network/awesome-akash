# handshake-full-listening-node-akash

This is an SDL file that will deploy a full listening handshake node onto akash.

[Link to Akash SDL File](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash/blob/master/handshake/deploy.yaml)

Deploy to Akash: 

1. https://console.akash.network/new-deployment

2. https://cloudmos.io/cloud-deploy 

Open Cloudmos and click "Deploy" 
<br>

Step 0: Choose the "Empty" option and paste the SDL file.
<br>

Step 1: Create a unique name under  `endpoints:` You will be changing line 4. Leave the colon.
<br>

Step 2: Use the same name to replace line 14. Leave ip: only change the name.
<br>

Step 3: Wait until the blockchain has synced (check the "logs" tab to see chain height or run `hsd-cli info` and check that `progress=1`) then edit the `--public-host` environment variable to reflect the instances public/static IP address. (Check the "Leases" tab for the IP) Once changed, click "Update Deployment"

Step 4: Click "shell" and type in ```hsd-cli info``` to see how many inbound connections after re-deploying. The "host" feild should show your public IP.

# Full Node that allows inbound connections from other full and light clients like hnsd
`<IP address>` MUST be your external IP address, publicly accessible by the internet.
```
hsd \
--bip37=true   \
--listen=true   \
--public-host=<IP address> \
--public-port=12038  \
--max-inbound=1000	
```
