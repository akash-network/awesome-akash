Know Your DeFi is a strategy and data platform for Decentralized Finance, providing a concise and intuitive data query interface that allows users to understand the DeFi projects they are interested in and adjust their strategies based on visual risk alerts. 

Know Your DeFi selects more reliable data sources, subgraphs from The Graph, to add strategy descriptions and risk tips to some of the data modules based on professional research findings, and to visualize the most critical risk tips. In this way, the value of the data to the user will be maximized. It helps users to better understand more projects in the DeFi ecosystem, and provides a super awesome use case of subgraphs.

The deploy.yaml uses the latest Docker image to deploy Know Your DeFi Dapp on Akash.
