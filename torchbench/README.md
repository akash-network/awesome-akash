# Torchbench SDL

## Choosing SDL 

Certain older cards such as the P4 and K80 do not support CUDA 12.  If you are on a card that has been dropped from cuda 12 support you will need to run the cuda 11.7 SDL 
Newer Cards support CUDA 12 and should use the CUDA 12 SDL. If your card was first released less than 4 years ago will probably want to use the CUDA 12 SDL
