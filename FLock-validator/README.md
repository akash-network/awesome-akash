# ðŸ”’ Run a FLock Validator on Akash

This is a template for running a FLock Validator on Akash. It enables users to run FLock's [Validator Script](https://github.com/FLock-io/llm-loss-validator/tree/main) directly from the Akash Console and earn FML rewards on [train.flock.io](http://train.flock.io/)

[train.flock.io](http://train.flock.io/) is the gateway to [FLock.io](http://flock.io/)'s decentralized AI training platform, AI Arena. It is currently on incentivised testnet, and all participants who have earned FML rewards will receive mainnet airdrops.

To participate, you need to first [get whitelisted](https://blog.flock.io/news/trainflock), acquire [FML test tokens](https://train.flock.io/faucet) and test tokens for Base Sepolia, then [stake FML](https://train.flock.io/stake) on the task you wish to validate.  Afterwards, you can use this template to run validation script with Akash compute; the script will fetch validation tasks and send scores automatically.
