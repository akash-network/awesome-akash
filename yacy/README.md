Using This SDL
--------------

- HTTP port 8090 must be exposed globally as port 80 (or YaCy will refuse to crawl without any error). Exposing HTTPS port 8443 is not required.
- Enabling persistent storage feature in SDL is highly recommended. Some settings in YaCy requires a server restart and it will reset all of your data.
- Default username and password to access administrative features is `admin` and `yacy`.
