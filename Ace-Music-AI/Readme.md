<h1 align="center">Pushing the Boundaries of Open-Source Music Generation</h1>

## 📝 Abstract
🚀 We present ACE-Step v1.5, a highly efficient open-source music foundation model that brings commercial-grade generation to consumer hardware. On commonly used evaluation metrics, ACE-Step v1.5 achieves quality beyond most commercial music models while remaining extremely fast—under 2 seconds per full song on an A100 and under 10 seconds on an RTX 3090. The model runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM, and supports lightweight personalization: users can train a LoRA from just a few songs to capture their own style.

🌉 At its core lies a novel hybrid architecture where the Language Model (LM) functions as an omni-capable planner: it transforms simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints—scaling from short loops to 10-minute compositions—while synthesizing metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought to guide the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). ⚡ Uniquely, this alignment is achieved through intrinsic reinforcement learning relying solely on the model's internal mechanisms, thereby eliminating the biases inherent in external reward models or human preferences. 🎚️

🔮 Beyond standard synthesis, ACE-Step v1.5 unifies precise stylistic control with versatile editing capabilities—such as cover generation, repainting, and vocal-to-BGM conversion—while maintaining strict adherence to prompts across 50+ languages. This paves the way for powerful tools that seamlessly integrate into the creative workflows of music artists, producers, and content creators. 🎸
