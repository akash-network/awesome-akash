# Deploying ThorChain BEPSwap UI on Akash

This is a guide to containerizing [ThorChain BEPSwap Web UI](https://github.com/thorchain/bepswap-web-ui) and deploying on [Akash](https://akash.network) in a non-custodial way. Akash is a permissionless and censorship-resistant cloud network that guarantees sovereignty over your data and your applications. With Akash, youâ€™re in complete control of all aspects of the life cycle of an application with no middleman.

Readme is adapted from [Serum on Akash](https://github.com/ovrclk/serum-on-akash), which is an excellent guide to getting started with DeFi deployments on Akash DeCloud.

## Before We Begin

This is a technical guide, best suited to a reader with basic Linux command line knowledge. The audience for this guide is intended for includes:

- Application developers with little or no systems administration experience, wanting to deploy applications on the decentralized cloud.
- System administrators with little or no experience with infrastructure automation, wanting to learn more.
- Infrastructure automation engineers that want to explore decentralized cloud.
- Anyone who wants to get a feel for the current state of the decentralized cloud ecosystem.

You will need the below setup before we being:

1. Install Akash: Make sure to have Akash client installed on your workstation, check [install guide](https://docs.akash.network/guides/install) for instructions.
2. Choose Your Akash Network: You'll need to know information about the network you're connecting your node to. See [Choosing a Network](https://docs.akash.network/guides/version) for how to obtain any network-related information.
3. Fund Your Account: You'll need a AKT wallet with funds to pay for your deployment. See the [funding guide](https://docs.akash.network/guides/funding)
   creating a key and funding your account.
4. Install Docker: You'll need docker running on your workstation, follow this [guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to setup Docker on your workstation..
5. Setup Container Registry: To stage your containers to deploy onto Akash. We'll use Docker Hub in this guide. [Signup](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/) for a free Docker Hub account if you haven't.
6. Setup Builpacks.io: Builpacks.io is a Cloud Native Buildpacks transform your application source code into images that can run on any cloud. Install `pack` tool using this [guide](https://buildpacks.io/docs/tools/pack/#install).

### Set up your Environment

We will be using shell variables throughout this guide for convenience and clarity. Ensure you have the below set of variables defined on your shell, you can use `export VARNAME=...`:

| Name              | Description                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AKASH_NODE`      | Akash network configuration base URL. See [here](/guides/version.md).                                               |
| `AKASH_CHAIN_ID`  | Chain ID of the Akash network connecting to. See [here](/guides/version.md).                                        |
| `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` | The address of your account. See [here](/guides/wallet/README.md#account-address).                                  |
| `KEY_NAME`        | The name of the key you will be deploying from. See [here](/guides/wallet/README.md) if you haven't yet setup a key |

Verify you have correct `$AKASH_NODE`, that you have populated while [configuring the connection](/guides/version) using `export AKASH_NODE=$(curl -s "$AKASH_NET/rpc-nodes.txt" | shuf -n 1)`.

```sh
echo $AKASH_NODE $AKASH_CHAIN_ID
```

You should see a response similar to:

```
tcp://rpc-edgenet.akashdev.net:2665 akash-edgenet-1
```

Your values may differ depending on the network you're connecting to, `tcp://rpc-edgenet.akashdev.net:2665` and `akash-edgenet-1` are details for [edgenet](https://github.com/ovrclk/net/tree/master/edgenet).

Verify you have the key set up and your account has sufficient balances, see the [funding guide](/guides/wallet/funding.md) otherwise:

My local key is named `alice`, the below command should return the name you've used:

```sh
echo $KEY_NAME
```

The above should return a response similar to:

```
alice
```

Populate `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` from `KEY_NAME` and verify:

```sh
export ACCOUNT_ADDRESS="$(akash keys show $KEY_NAME -a)"

echo $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS

akash1j8s87w3fctz7nlcqtkl5clnc805r240443eksx
```

Check your account has sufficient balance by running:

```sh
akash query bank balances --node $AKASH_NODE $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

You should see a response similar to:

```
balances:
- amount: "93000637"
  denom: uakt
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

Please note the balance indicated is is denominated in uAKT (AKT * 10^-6), in the above example, the account has a balance of *93 AKT\*. We're now setup to deploy.

## Build Thorchain BEPSwap UI Container

This setup is necessary for building the docker container. You can skip this step and process to deploying if you'd like deploy the existing container `edouardl/thorchain-bepswap-web-ui`

Get the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thorchain/bepswap-web-ui
cd bepswap-web-ui
```

Install dependencies using:

```
yarn install
```

Add `serve` dependency using:

```
yarn add serve
```

Create a `Procfile` to define the `web` process:

```sh
cat >Procfile<<EOF
web: yarn serve -s build
EOF>>
```

We will be using Heroku Buildpacks with Buildpack.io to build our container. First pick an image name and store it in `IMAGE` environment variable. I chose `edouardl/thorchain-bepswap-web-ui` as my image name, you should choose `<docker-id>/thorchain-bepswap-web-ui` as yours:

```sh
export IMAGE=edouardl/thorchain-bepswap-web-ui
```

To build the container, run:

```sh
pack build $IMAGE --builder heroku/buildpacks:18
```

Run the docker image locally to verify it works:

```sh
docker run -it --rm -e NODE_ENV=production -p 5000:5000 $IMAGE
```

Verify by visiting http://localhost:5000 on your browser.

Push the image to Docker Hub (Container Registry) using:

```
docker push $IMAGE
```

## Create the Deployment

Create a deployment configuration [thorchain.yaml](deploy.yaml) to deploy the `edouardl/thorchain-bepswap-web-ui` for [ThorChain BEPSwap Web UI](https://github.com/thorchain/bepswap-web-ui) Node JS app container using [SDL](https://docs.akash.network/documentation/sdl):

```sh
cat > thorchain.yaml <<EOF
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  web:
    image: edouardl/thorchain-bepswap-web-ui
    expose:
      - port: 5000
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true

profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 1.0
        memory:
          size: 512Mi
        storage:
          size: 512Mi
  placement:
    akash:
      signedBy:
        anyOf:
          - "akash1365yvmc4s7awdyj3n2sav7xfx76adc6dnmlx63"
      pricing:
        web:
          denom: uakt
          amount: 100

deployment:
  web:
    akash:
      profile: web
      count: 1

EOF>>
```

You may use the sample deployment file as-is or modify it for your own needs as desscribed in our [SDL (Stack Definition Language](https://docs.akash.network/documentation/sdl) documentation.

{% hint style="warn" %}

Please note if you are running on the testnet, you are limited in the amount of testnet resources you may request.

{% endhint %}

To deploy on Akash, run:

```sh
akash tx deployment create thorchain.yaml --from $KEY_NAME --node $AKASH_NODE --chain-id $AKASH_CHAIN_ID --fees 5000uakt -y
```

In this step, you post your deployment, the Akash marketplace matches you with a provider via auction. To create a deployment use akash deployment. The syntax for the deployment is `akash tx deployment create <config-path> --from <key-name>`.

You can check the status of your lease by running:

```
akash query market lease list --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --node $AKASH_NODE --state active

```

```yaml
- lease_id:
    dseq: "160398"
    gseq: 1
    oseq: 1
    owner: akash1j8s87w3fctz7nlcqtkl5clnc805r240443eksx
    provider: akash1uu8wfvxscqt7ax89hjkxral0r2k73c6ee97dzn
  price:
    amount: "51"
    denom: uakt
  state: active
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

In the above example, we can see that a lease is created using for _51 uakt_ or _0.0000051 AKT_ per block to execute the container.

For convenience and clarity for future referencing, we can extract the below set of values to shell variables that we will be using to reference the deployment:

| Attribute  | Value                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `PROVIDER` | `akash1uu8wfvxscqt7ax89hjkxral0r2k73c6ee97dzn` |
| `DSEQ`     | `160398`                                       |
| `OSEQ`     | `1`                                            |
| `GSEQ`     | `1`                                            |

Verify we have the right values populated by running:

```sh
echo $PROVIDER $DSEQ $OSEQ $GSEQ
```

You should see a response similar to:

```
akash1uu8wfvxscqt7ax89hjkxral0r2k73c6ee97dzn 160398 1 1
```

Upload the manifest using the values from above step:

```sh
akash provider send-manifest thorchain.yaml --node $AKASH_NODE --dseq $DSEQ --oseq $OSEQ --gseq $GSEQ --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --provider $PROVIDER
```

Your image is now deployed, once you uploaded the manifest. You can retrieve the access details by running the below:

```sh
akash provider lease-status --node $AKASH_NODE --dseq $DSEQ --oseq $OSEQ --gseq $GSEQ --provider $PROVIDER --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS
```

You should see a response similar to:

```json
{
  "services": {
    "web": {
      "name": "web",
      "available": 1,
      "total": 1,
      "uris": ["300cl9s3ulbph244b6qqp6dkm0.provider3.akashdev.net"],
      "observed-generation": 0,
      "replicas": 0,
      "updated-replicas": 0,
      "ready-replicas": 0,
      "available-replicas": 0
    }
  },
  "forwarded-ports": {}
}
```

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. In above example, its http://300cl9s3ulbph244b6qqp6dkm0.provider3.akashdev.net

## Service Logs

You can view the logs for your applicaiton using `akash provider service-logs`, for example:

```sh
akash provider service-logs --node $AKASH_NODE --dseq $DSEQ --oseq $OSEQ --gseq $GSEQ --provider $PROVIDER --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --service web
```

You should see a response similar to:

```
[web-7447d7769-c6t4f] yarn run v1.22.10
[web-7447d7769-c6t4f] $ /workspace/node_modules/.bin/serve build
[web-7447d7769-c6t4f] INFO: Accepting connections at http://localhost:5000
```

## Close your deployment

When you are done with your application, close the deployment. This will deprovision your container and stop the token transfer. Close deployment using deployment by creating a `deployment-close` transaction:

```sh
akash tx deployment close --node $AKASH_NODE --chain-id $AKASH_CHAIN_ID --dseq $DSEQ --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --from $KEY_NAME -y --fees 5000uakt
```

Additionally, you can also query the market to check if your lease is closed:

```sh
akash query market lease list --owner $ACCOUNT_ADDRESS --node $AKASH_NODE
```

You should see a response similar to:

```yaml
leases:
  - lease_id:
      dseq: "160398"
      gseq: 1
      oseq: 1
      owner: akash1j8s87w3fctz7nlcqtkl5clnc805r240443eksx
      provider: akash1uu8wfvxscqt7ax89hjkxral0r2k73c6ee97dzn
    price:
      amount: "186"
      denom: uakt
    state: closed
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
