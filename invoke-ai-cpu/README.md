## Quick Start

1. Once it starts up, open your browser and go to <http://{AKASH_URI}>.
2. Open the model manager tab to install a starter model and then you'll be ready to generate.

More detail, including hardware requirements and manual install instructions, are available in the [installation documentation][installation docs].

## Docker Container

We publish official container images in Github Container Registry: https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/pkgs/container/invokeai. Both CUDA and ROCm images are available. Check the above link for relevant tags.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that Docker is set up to use the GPU. Refer to [NVIDIA][nvidia docker docs] or [AMD][amd docker docs] documentation.

### Generate!

Run the container, modifying the command as necessary:

```bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia --gpus=all --publish 9090:9090 ghcr.io/invoke-ai/invokeai
```

Then open `http://localhost:9090` and install some models using the Model Manager tab to begin generating.

For ROCm, add `--device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri` to the `docker run` command.

### Persist your data

You will likely want to persist your workspace outside of the container. Use the `--volume /home/myuser/invokeai:/invokeai` flag to mount some local directory (using its **absolute** path) to the `/invokeai` path inside the container. Your generated images and models will reside there. You can use this directory with other InvokeAI installations, or switch between runtime directories as needed.

### DIY

Build your own image and customize the environment to match your needs using our `docker-compose` stack. See [README.md](./docker/README.md) in the [docker](./docker) directory.

## Troubleshooting, FAQ and Support

## Features

### Web Server & UI

Invoke runs a locally hosted web server & React UI with an industry-leading user experience.

### Unified Canvas

The Unified Canvas is a fully integrated canvas implementation with support for all core generation capabilities, in/out-painting, brush tools, and more. This creative tool unlocks the capability for artists to create with AI as a creative collaborator, and can be used to augment AI-generated imagery, sketches, photography, renders, and more.

### Workflows & Nodes

Invoke offers a fully featured workflow management solution, enabling users to combine the power of node-based workflows with the easy of a UI. This allows for customizable generation pipelines to be developed and shared by users looking to create specific workflows to support their production use-cases.

### Board & Gallery Management

Invoke features an organized gallery system for easily storing, accessing, and remixing your content in the Invoke workspace. Images can be dragged/dropped onto any Image-base UI element in the application, and rich metadata within the Image allows for easy recall of key prompts or settings used in your workflow.
